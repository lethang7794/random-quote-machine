# A Random Quote Machine

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not listed above are not recommended and using them is at your own risk. We are looking at supporting other frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue, but they are not currently supported. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

You can build your project by using this CodePen template and clicking Save to create your own pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js

Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.

Note: Twitter does not allow links to be loaded in an iframe. Try using the target="\_blank" or target="\_top" attribute on the #tweet-quote element if your tweet won't load. target="\_top" will replace the current tab so make sure your work is saved.
